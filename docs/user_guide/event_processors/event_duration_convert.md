The `event-duration-convert` processor converts duration written as string to a integer with second precision.

The string format supported is a series of digits and a single letter indicating the unit, e.g 1w3d (1 week 3 days)
The highest unit is `w` for week and the lowest is `s` for second.
Any of the units may or may not be present.

### Examples

#### simple conversion

```yaml
processors:
  # processor name
  convert-uptime:
    # processor type
    event-duration-convert:
      # list of regex to be matched with the values names
      value-names: 
        - ".*_uptime$"
      # keep the original value, 
      # a new value name will be added with the converted value,
      # the new value name will be the original name with _seconds as suffix 
      keep: false
      # debug, enables this processor logging
      debug: false
```
